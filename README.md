# Quick Overview:

We established three distinct player types and categorized each player into a category using Agglomerative Clustering.

Clusters:
- Player type 0 is more team-focused
- Player type 1 is more defensive
- Player type 2 is more aggressive

Each team was assigned a team composition based on their players' playstyles.

Our analysis revealed that the team composition (4, 1, 0): 4 type 0's, 1 type 1's, and 0 type 2's, with a win rate of 68%, appears to be the most successful.
It can be considered an outlier since only one team (Edward Gaming) uses it.

(0, 3, 2) emerges as the best out of the commonly picked team compositions with a win rate of 49%, supported by 811 matches from 17 teams.

Our Team, Sentinels, has the (0, 4, 1) composition: 0 type 0's, 4 type 1's, and 1 type 2. This team composition lands around the middle regarding win rate, so we see opportunities for improvement.

Two of our players are retiring in 2024 (Tenz and Sacy) - both are type 1 players.
In their place, we need to recruit a type 1 player and a type 2 player.
This achieves the optimal best team composition (0, 3, 2) for Sentinels and can help us advance higher in the 2025 Valorant Champions Tour.
